**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** Start: October 14, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC+03), End: October 15, 2023, 2:30 AM (UTC+03)
- **Impact:** The outage affected our primary web application, causing it to be entirely unavailable for approximately 16 hours. Approximately 75% of our user base experienced service disruption, resulting in frustration and potential revenue loss.

**Timeline:**
- **Detection:** October 14, 2023, 10:30 AM - Our monitoring system triggered an alert for increased server response times.
- **Actions Taken:** The on-call engineer noticed the alert, and a quick investigation began. The team initially suspected a database issue.
- **Misleading Paths:** The team initially focused on the database cluster, believing it might be the root cause. This assumption led to hours of fruitless troubleshooting.
- **Escalation:** After six hours, the incident was escalated to the senior infrastructure team.
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved on October 15, 2023, 2:30 AM, when it was identified as a misconfigured firewall rule.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured firewall rule that blocked incoming traffic to the web servers. This misconfiguration occurred during routine maintenance, resulting in unintended access restrictions.

- **Resolution:** The misconfigured firewall rule was corrected by the senior infrastructure team. They updated the firewall rule to allow incoming traffic as required. Additionally, they implemented a review process to prevent similar misconfigurations during future maintenance.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
To prevent similar outages and improve our incident response, we are taking the following measures:
- **Review Change Procedures:** We will implement a more robust change management process that includes a thorough review of configuration changes to prevent similar misconfigurations.

- **Enhance Monitoring:** We will enhance our monitoring system to provide early detection of firewall rule changes. This will help us identify any accidental or unauthorized rule modifications promptly.

- **Training and Awareness:** We will conduct additional training for all team members involved in infrastructure management to improve their awareness of the potential impact of configuration changes.

- **Documentation Improvement:** We will update and maintain comprehensive documentation for all critical configurations, ensuring that team members have easy access to essential information.

- **Regular Drills:** We will conduct regular fire drills and simulations to test our incident response procedures and improve coordination among teams.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
- [ ] Implement a formal change management process with mandatory review steps for all configuration changes.
- [ ] Improve monitoring by setting up alerts for specific types of firewall rule changes.
- [ ] Provide in-depth training for the team on the importance of precise configuration management.
- [ ] Create, update, and maintain detailed documentation on key configuration settings.
- [ ] Schedule and conduct regular incident response drills to refine our response processes.

In conclusion, the recent web stack outage highlighted the critical need for improved change management and monitoring processes. By taking these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance our system's resilience and ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. Our commitment to continuous improvement will help us maintain the highest level of service for our users.
