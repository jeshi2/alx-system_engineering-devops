# MySQL 5.7 Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install MySQL 5.7 on your Ubuntu-based system. MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that is widely used for web applications and other data-driven software.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An Ubuntu-based system (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04).
- Administrative access (sudo or root privileges) on your system.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install MySQL 5.7:

### 1. Copy the GPG Key

Visit the MySQL documentation page to obtain the GPG key for MySQL 5.7 by clicking the following link: [MySQL 5.7 GPG Key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/checking-gpg-signature.html).

Copy the GPG key to your clipboard.

### 2. Save the GPG Key

Open a terminal window and save the GPG key in a file named `signature.key` on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
echo "PASTE_THE_COPIED_KEY_HERE" > signature.key
```

Replace `"PASTE_THE_COPIED_KEY_HERE"` with the actual GPG key you copied in step 1.

### 3. Add the APT Repository

Next, add the MySQL APT repository to your system by running the following command:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu bionic mysql-5.7" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list'
```

This command appends the MySQL APT repository to your system's package sources.

### 4. Update APT

Update your system's package list to include the MySQL repository:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### 5. Check Available Versions

To confirm that the MySQL 5.7 packages are available for installation, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-cache policy mysql-server
```

You should see information about the MySQL server packages, including version numbers. Ensure that `5.7` is listed in the output.

### 6. Install MySQL 5.7

Finally, install MySQL 5.7 by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-client=5.7* mysql-community-server=5.7* mysql-server=5.7*
```

This command installs the MySQL client and server components with version 5.7.

## Configuration

Once the installation is complete, you can configure MySQL 5.7 according to your requirements. Be sure to set up user accounts, passwords, and databases as needed.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed MySQL 5.7 on your Ubuntu-based system. You can now start using MySQL for your database needs. If you have any specific configuration or usage requirements, please refer to the MySQL documentation for further guidance.
